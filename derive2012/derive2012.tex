\begin{abstract}
The chorus of the popular song \emph{TiK ToK} by the artist \emph{Ke\$ha}\footnote{\url{http://www.mtv.com/videos/keha/445445/tik-tok.jhtml}} goes \emph{``Don't stop, make it pop. DJ, blow my speakers up. Tonight, I'mma fight. 'Til we see the sunlight. Tik tok on the clock. But the party don't stop, no''}. We all know, however, that each nightlife event, be it a~party, concert, or bar evening, comes to an end eventually. With NiteOutMag, we present a~Chrome Web application that can help people revive nightlife events in the recent past. Among the younger generation, nightlife activities---just like any other activity---together with related multimedia data get shared online on social networks. The problem is that for one and the same event, the event-related user-generated data may be shared on a~plethora of social networks. Therefore, with this paper, we introduce an application that extracts, reconciles, and models events from several event databases or calendars, social data from multiple social networks, and media data from some media sharing platforms. The collected data is attached to events held in a~given area and further processed to generate an event-centric magazine where each page represents an event illustrated by media items.

\section{Introduction}                                                      \label{sec:introduction}
In March 2012, 901 million monthly active users of the social networking site (SNS) Facebook have uploaded more than 300 million photos on average per day~\cite{Facebook2012}. Many of those photos are event-related and often illustrate nightlife events such as music concerts that a~user has attended. Facebook, however, albeit the biggest, is only one among a~plethora of social networks that people use to share event-related content.
A~social network is an online service or media platform that focuses on building and reflecting social relationships among people sharing interests and/or activities.

\subsection{Considered Social Networking Sites}
In this paper, we consider eleven different social networks that represent all together most of the Western world's market share. In detail, the considered social networks are
\googleplus (\url{google.com/+}),
Myspace (\url{myspace.com}),
Facebook (\url{facebook.com}),
Twitter ({\url{twitter.com}),
Instagram (\url{instagram.com}),
Flickr (\url{flickr.com}),
YouTube (\url{youtube.com}),
yfrog (\url{yfrog.com}),
Twitpic (\url{twitpic.com}), and
MobyPicture (\url{mobypicture.com}),
\mbox{img.ly} (\url{img.ly}).

\subsection{Considered Event Databases or Calendars}
The actual detection of events based on information from SNSs is out of scope for this paper. We observe that this has become a~very active research field. For example, Petkos \emph{et al.} propose to detect events using a~multimodal clustering approach~\cite{Petkos2012}. In this paper, we will consider event databases or calendars that maintain listings of past and upcoming events using crowd sourcing techniques and that can be queried programmatically. More precisely, we consider four event databases, namely Eventful (\url{eventful.com}), Foursquare (\url{foursquare.com}), Upcoming (\url{upcoming.org}), and Google Places (\url{google.com/places}).

\subsection{Contributions and Paper Structure}
In this paper, we propose an approach to fully automatically generate an event-centric magazine where each page corresponds to a~known event that is illustrated with media shared on the Web.
The application is available online for testing purposes at \url{http://users.restdesc.org/rgverbor/tmp/NiteOutMag.crx}. A~screencast showcasing the application is available at \url{http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/5pEiy2RHBjY}.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:related-work} presents some related work aiming at creating summaries and narratives of events using social media. Section~\ref{sec:implementation} details our approach: we start from a~given location and we collect the events and their illustrative media in a~recent past before assembling a~digital magazine. In Section~\ref{sec:experiments}, we present and discuss the results we obtained on an experiment. Finally, we give our conclusions and outline future work in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Related Work}                                                      \label{sec:related-work}
Capturing life moments and building narratives using social networks is addressed in~\cite{Atosy2011}, where the authors investigated about the interaction between event stories and the use of social networks to tell them. They proposed Storify~\cite{Storify2012}, a~Web application which supports users to perform story telling and in particular: (1) sorting and organizing the items of an experience similar to the elements of a~story, (2) communicating and discussing strategies on how to guide a~user towards an intended experience. The overall storytelling creation is supervised by the user, who describes the story as a~crafted experience~\cite{Hassenzahl2010}. Streams of news navigate through the social platforms such as Twitter, YouTube. Getting the big picture from them is the objective of Storyful~\cite{Storyful2012}. This application allows the user to navigate through the story created by other users or to create his own aggregating the content available from Twitter, Youtube and adding more.

Events have a~key role in the human life and illustrating events with media items stemming from social networks is a~very active research topic. In~\cite{Brenner2012}, Brenner and Izquierdo present an approach to detect social events and retrieve associated photos in collaboratively annotated photo collections combining data of various modalities such as time, location, and textual and visual features. In~\cite{Liu2011}, Liu \emph{et al.} present a~method for combining semantic inferencing and visual analysis for automatically gathering photos and videos illustrating events. Regarding aesthetic aspects of media compilation, in~\cite{Sandhaus2011}, Sandhaus \emph{et al.} consider visual and aesthetic features for the automatic creation of photo books. Obrador \emph{et al.} use visual and aesthetic features for~a category-based approach to automatically assess the aesthetic appeal of photographs~\cite{Obrador2012}.

\section{Implementation}                                                    \label{sec:implementation}
In this section, we provide the implementation details of the NiteOutMag application. It is implemented as a~Chrome application since this technique provides a~transparent statement about the required resources of the application, \emph{i.e.}, cross-domain access to event databases and search APIs.

\subsection{Geocoding}
The application focuses on events that occurred in a~certain area. While event databases tend to work based on concrete GPS points like
\mbox{(40.7590110, -73.98447220)}, \emph{i.e.}, a~pair composed of a~latitude and a~longitude, human beings use more human-friendly place names such as \emph{Times Square, New York}. Geocoding is the process of finding the geographic coordinates (generally expressed as latitude and longitude) associated to other geographic data such as an address composed of a~street name and a~zip code. The user can enter an exact address, like \emph{618 W. 46th St, New York, NY 10036}, or a~very broad area like \emph{Las Vegas}. The returned latitude and longitude pair is always the center of the particular area of interest. In our implementation, we use the Google Geocoding API~\cite{Geocoding2012}.

\subsection{Event Search} \label{sec:event-search}
Based on a~latitude and longitude pair, we search for events that took place near this location (in a~radius of five kilometers) in the recent past using the respective event search APIs from Eventful, Foursquare,Google Places, and Upcoming~\cite{Eventful2012,Foursquare2012,GooglePlaces2012,Upcoming2012}.

\subsection{Event Categories}
Event databases or calendars typically classify events in different categories.
Our focus with NiteOutMag being nightlife events,
wherever possible we filter events to match
a~manually compiled list of nightlife-type categories.
For Foursquare, this includes the categories \emph{nightlife} and \emph{arts \& entertainment}.
For Eventful, this includes the categories \emph{music}, \emph{festivals\_parades}, and \emph{singles\_social}.
For Upcoming, this includes the categories \emph{Music}, \emph{Performing/Visual Arts}, \emph{Media}, \emph{Festivals}, and \emph{Comedy}.
For Google Places, no such event filtering is possible.
Google Places, as the name of the service suggests, focuses on places.
If an event is known to take place at a~place, its event data are returned by the service.
In consequence, for Google Places, rather than filtering on event categories,
we filter on place categories to include typical nightlife places
such as clubs, discothèques, bars, movie theaters, etc.

\subsection{Event Reconciliation}
We sanitize event titles by removing HTML tags, punctuation, and
common abbreviations such as \emph{w/}, which becomes \emph{with}; or \emph{ft./feat.}, which becomes \emph{featuring}.
Event directories can overlap in their coverage.
Therefore, we reconcile the returned set of events based on the simple, yet effective Levenshtein distance of the event titles with an empirically determined editing distance of five.
If in a~final check also the event start times are within a~window of one hour,
we regard the events the same.
We recall that due to our event search approach outlined in Subsection~\ref{sec:event-search},
events are already geographically close.
In consequence, we are capable to detect that two events with similar event titles like, \emph{e.g.}, \emph{Titanic} and \emph{Titanic 3D} and start times of 8:00PM and 8:30PM most probably correspond to the same movie event.

\subsection{Event Modeling with Schema.org}
The considered event databases use different event modeling schemas.
In order to have a~common event representation internally, 
we use \texttt{schema:Event} properties~\cite{schemaorgevent} from the schema.org vocabulary,
which are also mapped to \texttt{dbo:Event} from the DBpedia Ontology~\cite{dbpedia2schemaorg}.
We maintain a~straight-forward alignment of the particular event database properties
from Eventful, Foursquare, Upcoming, and Google Places to schema.org properties.
Concretely, we support the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{name} The name of the event.
  \item \texttt{description} A~short description of the event.
  \item \texttt{location} The location of the event.
  \item \texttt{startDate} The start date and time of the event (in ISO 8601 date format).
  \item \texttt{endDate} The end date and time of the event (in ISO 8601 date format).
  \item \texttt{url} The URL of the event.
  \item \texttt{image} The URL of an image of the event.
\end{itemize}
At this stage of NiteOutMag, we do not expose these event representations externally,
however, have shown how events coming from different sources
can be exposed in a~related project~\cite{Liu2011}.

\subsection{Media Search} \label{sec:media-search}
Unlike event search, media search in our application is \emph{not} based on geolocation. According to a~study performed in May 2012 by Seline~\cite{Quora2012},
only roughly 1\% of all microposts on Twitter are geotagged. In addition to that, as our approach covers more SNSs than Twitter, we need to consider that not all SNSs support geotagging of content. In consequence, we use a~two-tier approach for media search. We illustrate this by a~real event of a~Beach Boys concert\footnote{\url{http://www.thebeachboys.com/\#tour}} in the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, MD. The event title is \emph{Beach Boys},
the venue name is \emph{Merriweather Post Pavilion}, and the area is \emph{Columbia, Maryland (MD)}. We define as \emph{human-friendly address} the first part up to the comma of the \texttt{formatted\_address} field in the Google Geocoding API~\cite{Geocoding2012}, \emph{i.e.}, \emph{Columbia} in this case. Human beings aware of the local context do not need to disambiguate, \emph{i.e.}, there is no need to explicitly state \emph{MD}. The two-tier approach consists thus of a~full-text search for:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{(i)} the (event title) $+$ the (venue name), and
 \item \emph{(ii)} the (event title) $+$ the (human-friendly address).
\end{itemize}

We have implemented a~media collector consisting of media extractors for all SNSs listed in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}.
This media collector was first described in~\cite{Khrouf2012}.
It takes a~search term as input, \emph{e.g.}, \emph{Beach Boys Columbia} for the example above, and then performs a~parallel full-text search using the search APIs of all SNSs. When all the media extractors have responded, a~unified SNS-agnostic output is delivered. We propose a~common alignment schema, illustrated in Listing~\ref{lst:media}, which shows the resulting metadata for an exemplary media item. Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture} depicts the overall architecture of the media collector.

\end{figure*}

\subsection{Magazine Layout}
In order to create the illusion of a~real magazine, the ability of flipping from page to page needs to be as credible as possible. The open-source library \texttt{turn.js} by Emmanuel García~\cite{TurnJs2012} allows for the dynamic creation of magazines solely based on HTML5 technologies with a~very realistic page flip effect. We treat each event as one page of the magazine, add the event metadata as headline and subheading of the page, and arrange the images and accompanying microposts to fill up the page as illustration. For each event, we use the image with the highest resolution as background image of the page in order to create a~lifestyle magazine appearance. For additional print-like look and feel, we use drop caps (Fig.~\ref{fig:screenshot}). The title page gets dynamically created based on a~Google image search for the (human-friendly address) $+$ the keyword (nightlife).

\subsection{Installation Instructions}
The NiteOutMag application requires the Chrome browser. Download the application from the URL \url{http://goo.gl/fjuE5} to the local file system.
Once there, drag and drop it into the \url{chrome://chrome/extensions/} page in the browser. When you drop it on the extensions page, you will notice an install option popping up. When you agree to install, you will see the standard installation dialog that informs you about the rights that the application is requesting. It needs access to the event databases and media search APIs we have mentioned before.

\section{Evaluation}
We have conducted a~short user study whose survey is publicly
available\footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEY1aVJfSk5aQnVPRzBlSmVIUEVTa1E6MQ\#gid=0}}.
Overall 12 male (unfortunately no female followed our open call for participation) participants with an average social media experience of 3.9
(all values are between 1 and 5) have evaluated NiteOutMag.
We asked participants to evaluate the application for the cities of Las Vegas and Hong Kong.
Las Vegas is known to have good event coverage in the considered event databases,
whereas Hong Kong is known to have bad coverage.
Further, we asked them to evaluate the application with a city of choice.
Our evaluation criteria were
\emph{speed} at which a~magazine for a given city was generated,
\emph{usefulness} of the selected events,
\emph{relevancy} of the selected images, and
\emph{attractiveness} of the events and media.
Further, we allowed for optional free-form answers to the following questions: 
``How could NiteOutMag be improved?'', ``How many pages did you count in NiteOutMag?'', and
``How many event sources did you count in NiteOutMag?''.

\subsection{Number of Pages and Number of Event Sources}
For Las Vegas, on average participants counted 10.3 pages in their magazines and 2.0 event sources,
for Hong Kong participants counted 1 page and 0.9 event sources,
and for their city of choice participants counted 4.2 pages and 1.3 event sources.
This reflects the initial observation that Hong Kong has bad, and Las Vegas good event coverage, with the random cities of choice ranging in between.

\subsection{Suggested Improvements}
The most demanded feature was to add more content to the magazine.
More event sources and more social networks are ways to address this request.
As pages are generated and removed dynamically,
sometimes when not enough media content is found for an event,
pages get removed when a~user is looking at them.
This causes confusion, however, is owed to the inflexible API of \texttt{turn.js}~\cite{TurnJs2012}.
We will investigate ways to add pages
only once it is known that enough event content is available.
An often suggested feature was to load page contents only on demand
rather than all at once for the whole magazine,
which is the current implementation.
Again the API of \texttt{turn.js}
and the desire to allow for fast page flipping makes it hard to find a~good compromise,
however, a~reimplementation of the page flipping code can take this request into account.

\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{./screenshot.jpg}
\caption{Screenshot of the NiteOutMag application with two events from Las Vegas and the righthand-side page about to be flipped}
\label{fig:screenshot}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion and Future Work}
The results stand and fall with the quality of the events in the event databases. One of the problem we encounter are event titles such as
\emph{Kandyland 2012 @ the Playboy Mansion -- 1.877.VIP.MANSION}\footnote{\url{http://t.co/YUm7FtmE}} which combine the event title with the venue name
and a~vanity contact phone number. The detection of such composed titles is difficult and requires advanced linguistic processing.

Event reconciliation is a~second issue. The two movie events \emph{The Avengers} and \emph{Marvel's The Avengers 3D} are the same for a~human being. However, for a~machine, the duplication is harder to detect. Media item reconciliation improvement is a~task that we have left for future work.

The system's response time is improvable. The main issue here is the browser-enforced maximum number of simultaneous HTTP requests. With our current four event sources that we have limited to ten events per source, we already have up to forty events that we need to search media items for. As outlined before in Section~\ref{sec:media-search}, we have opted for a~two-tier approach in order to improve the recall, which effectively means two search requests per event.
Assuming that for each search request we get on average only two media items, we have roundabout $5+40*2*2=165$ HTTP requests for only one magazine. We will investigate ways to improve the application's responsiveness in the future.

\section{Conclusion}                                                        \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have reported on a~Chrome Web application that illustrates events via four event databases and eleven social networks and media sharing platforms. The application harvests event-related data on-the-fly for a~user-determined center of interest and compiles the data in an aesthetic lifestyle magazine. Using popular party destinations, big cities, and places of interests, we have evaluated the retrieved results for both relevancy and visual appeal, with a~special focus on optimized recall. While there are actionable issues for future work, we are quite happy with the outcome so far.
